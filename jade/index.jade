        p The clockblock, available for sale at <a href='http://clockblock.me' target='_blank'>clockblock.me</a>, is a minimalist clock that uses LEDs instead of hands and lives in a beautiful block of Louisiana cypress. It is a collaboration between <a href='http://wileycousins.com' target='_blank'>Wiley Cousins</a> (Cole Wiley and myself) and Trig Studios (James Goedert).
        p We machine a solid block of cypress with holes that go right up to, but not through, the surface of the block. Each of those holes gets an LED that shines through the thin layer of wood that's left. There are thrity six LEDs: twelve arms each with an hour, minute, and second LED.
        p The leds are controlled by a custom set of PCBs running firmware written in C++. I designed the boards and wrote all the firmware. We've open sourced everything, and it's available at <a href='http://github.com/wileycousins/clockblock' target='_blank'>the clockblock github page</a>.
        p A bulk of the machining is done by CNC. I built models of the block in CAD and generated all the toolpaths that we run on the blocks. It's fun to watch.

      h2 obligatory "Hello, world!"
      p To which the world replied, "Shut the Hell up; it's one in the morning."
      p This sentiment, of course, was a ridiculous sentiment for the world to express for a variety of reasons. These reasons included (but were in no way limited to) the concept of time zones, the fact that the world is an abstract concept incapable of speech (or a planet, also incapable of human speech), and that there is no way for the world to, in fact, hear the greeting that was presented to it.
