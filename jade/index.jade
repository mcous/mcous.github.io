      p Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a mechatronics engineer with a passion for open-source hardware and software, design, and coffee. One day I am going to build an open-source coffee-making robot. Until then, get in touch with me if you want to make something cool.

        p The <strong>clockblock</strong>, available for sale at <a href='http://clockblock.me' target='_blank'>clockblock.me</a>, is a minimalist clock that uses LEDs instead of hands and lives in a beautiful block of Louisiana cypress. It is a collaboration between <a href='http://wileycousins.com' target='_blank'>Wiley Cousins</a> (<a href='http://hcwiley.com/' target='_blank'>H. Cole Wiley</a> and myself) and Trig Studios (James Goedert).
        p We machine a solid block of cypress with holes that go right up to, but not through, the surface of the block. Each of those holes gets an LED that shines through the thin layer of wood that's left. There are thrity six LEDs: twelve arms each with an hour, minute, and second LED.
        p The leds are controlled by a custom set of PCBs running firmware written in C++. I designed the boards and wrote all the firmware. We've open sourced everything, and it's available at <a href='http://github.com/wileycousins/clockblock' target='_blank'>the clockblock github page</a>.
        p A bulk of the machining is done by CNC. I built models of the block in CAD and generated all the toolpaths that we run on the blocks. It's fun to watch.

          li through hole component: 36 LEDs (we like surface mount)
          li lines of code: just over 1700
          li how often I lose my favorite set of tweezers when building a clock: every fourteen minutes

        p Another <a href='http://wileycousins.com target='_blank>Wiley Cousins</a> and Trig Studios collaboration, <strong>lamp</strong> continues the theme of LEDs and wood. There's a pattern here. For <strong>lamp</strong>, we've designed a modular electronics package that can sense how it's been configured, allowing us to use the same lighting system in a variety of form factors.
        p <strong>lamp</strong> is a product in active development, which you can watch at <a href='http://github.com/wileycousins/lamp' target='_blank'>the lamp github page</a>. The first version to be offered for sale will be available in a variety of configurations, including a wifi enabled version.
        p I am designing all the PCBs for <strong>lamp</strong> and writing all the firmware. PCBs and firmware are things I do. In case you hadn't noticed, I am trying to stress those skills. Head on: apply directly to the forehead.

        p <strong>reflow</strong> is a shockingly creatively titled circuit board I designed to hack a regular old toaster oven into a solder reflow oven. It's a microcontroller, a thermocouple jack and amplifier (for precise temperature feedback), and a solid-state AC relay. It's allows me to work almost exclusively in surface mount components when designing circuit boards.
        p After using it for a little while, I realized it could be used for any AC heating appliance. I've also used it to convert a slow cooker into a sous vide machine, and I'm working on a new revision that'll make it work better as a generic temperature feedback heater controller.
        p I've open sourced the designs, and they're available at <a href='http://github.com/mcous/reflow' target='_blank'>the reflow github page</a>.
