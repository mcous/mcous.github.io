Mocking is a fantastic tool for writing high-quality unit tests, but **nothing
creates useless testing pain quite like poorly used mocks**. One type of
mocking[^1] - creating and configuring stubs - is particularly useful, but hard
to do well with [Vitest's][vitest] built-in [mock functions][].

[^1]:
    In case you have strong opinions about jargon: I use the word "mock" in this
    article to mean "[test double][]." It's less typing!

Inspired by a couple of my favorite testing libraries - [testdouble.js][] and
[jest-when][] - I set out to write an easy-to-use stubbing library specifically
for Vitest to provide focused design feedback throughout my tests.

Introducing: :tada: [vitest-when][] :tada:, a library that wraps Vitest mock
functions so you can spend more time building and less time futzing around with
mocks.

```shell
npm install --save-dev vitest-when
```

## What is a stub?

A "stub" is a fake function in a test that you configure with "canned"
responses. When a stub is called with the right arguments, it returns its
preconfigured response. If it's called the wrong way, it simply no-ops.

You can use vitest-when to configure a `vi.fn()` mock function as a stub:

```ts
import { vi, expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { when } from 'vitest-when'

test('stub something', () => {
  const sayHello = vi.fn()

  when(sayHello).calledWith('Alice').thenReturn('Hello, Alice')
  when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenReturn('Hey, Bob')

  expect(sayHello('Alice')).toBe('Hello, Alice')
  expect(sayHello('Bob')).toBe('Hey, Bob')
  expect(sayHello('Carlos')).toBe(undefined)
})
```

In the above example, the `sayHello` stub behaves accordingly:

- When `sayHello` is called with `Alice`, it will return `Hello, Alice`
- When `sayHello` is called with `Bob`, it will return `Hey, Bob`
- When `sayHello` is called in any other way, it will return `undefined`

Stubs are useful when you're mocking a function that returns data. You set up a
stub that says "I'll return the correct data, but only if I get called with the
right arguments", inject it into your code-under-test, and see if your code
produces the correct output.

Functions that act upon input data to produce output data - i.e. functions that
return something - are easier to reason with, assemble, and observe than
functions that return nothing and solely produce side-effects. Because stubs
make it easier to test your code's interaction with output-producing APIs, using
stubs exerts design pressure to prefer writing functions that return something.
In general, this leads to code with fewer hard-to-reason-with side-effects.

## What can vitest-when do?

You can use vitest-when to configure a stub with several behaviors.

```ts
// Return a value
when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenReturn('Hello, Bob')

// Resolve a Promise
when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenResolve('Hello, Bob')

// Throw an error
when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenThrow(new Error('Bye'))

// Reject a Promise
when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenReject(new Error('Bye'))

// Run an arbitrary function
when(sayHello)
  .calledWith('Bob')
  .thenDo((name) => `Hello, ${name}`)
```

The same stub can have multiple different behaviors configured, depending on the
arguments it's called with.

```ts
when(sayHello).calledWith('Alice').thenReturn('Hello, Alice')
when(sayHello).calledWith('Bob').thenReturn('Hello, Bob')
when(sayHello).calledWith('Chad').thenThrow(new Error('Nah'))
```

The `calledWith` method accepts Vitest's [asymmetric matchers][], so you can focus
on specifying what's important without losing out on test completeness.

```ts
when(sayHello).calledWith(expect.any(String)).thenReturn('Hello!')
```

Finally, because vitest-when is a thin wrapper around vanilla Vitest mock
functions, it's fully compatible with `vi.mock` module automocking.

```ts
import { vi, describe, afterEach, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { when } from 'vitest-when'

import { getAnswer } from './deep-thought.ts'
import { getQuestion } from './earth.ts'
import * as subject from './meaning-of-life.ts'

vi.mock('./deep-thought.ts')
vi.mock('./earth.ts')

describe('get the meaning of life', () => {
  it('should get the answer and the question', async () => {
    when(getAnswer).calledWith().thenResolve(42)
    when(getQuestion).calledWith(42).thenResolve("What's 6 by 9?")

    const result = await subject.createMeaning()

    expect(result).toEqual({
      question: "What's 6 by 9?",
      answer: 42,
    })
  })
})
```

## Why use vitest-when?

Vitest's built-in mock functions, returned by `vi.fn()`, are powerful and
flexible. However in my experience with Vitest (and Jest before it), their API
is easy to misuse, leaving you and your team with tests that are hard to read
and misbehave often.

Take these two trivial "tests", one with vitest-when and the other without:

```ts
import { vi, expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { when } from 'vitest-when'

const sayHello = vi.fn()

test('with vitest-when', () => {
  when(sayHello).calledWith('Alice').thenReturn('Hello, Alice')

  const result = sayHello('Alice')

  expect(result).toBe('Hello, Alice')
})

test('without vitest-when', () => {
  sayHello.mockReturnValue('Hello, Alice')

  const result = sayHello('Alice')

  expect(result).toBe('Hello, Alice')
  expect(sayHello).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Alice')
})
```

With vitest-when, **all configured behaviors are conditional**. You must define
a complete set of arguments that will trigger the behavior, as a cause and
effect:

```ts
when(sayHello)
  .calledWith('Alice') // cause
  .thenReturn('Hello, Alice') // effect
```

In vanilla Vitest, however, you use methods like `mockReturnValue`. These
methods are unconditional; the configured behavior will trigger no matter how
the mock is called, even it's called incorrectly.

```ts
sayHello.mockReturnValue('Hello, Alice')

expect(sayHello('Alice')).toBe('Hello, Alice')
expect(sayHello('Bob')).toBe('Hello, Alice')
expect(sayHello('Carlos')).toBe('Hello, Alice')
```

This increases the likelihood that you'll write a test that passes when it
shouldn't, because the code under test might call the stub incorrectly and still
receive the configured return value.

In order to avoid writing a test that incorrectly passes, you have to add
assertion(s) near the bottom of your test that the mock was called correctly:

```ts
sayHello.mockReturnValue('Hello, Alice') // effect

const result = sayHello('Alice')

expect(result).toBe('Hello, Alice')
expect(sayHello).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Alice') // assert cause
```

The argument assertion lives after, and away from, the return value, making the
test harder to read and maintain compared to vitest-when's strategy of
configuring a cause and effect at the same time.

You also perform an _assertion_ to check the arguments, which is a more forceful
check that vitest-when's "filter by arguments and no-op otherwise" strategy.
Mocking, by necessity, introduces coupling between your tests and the
implementation of your code under test. Higher coupling forces can lead to more
frequent false test failures. Filtering by arguments is sufficient to ensure
correctness, and is a looser form of coupling than an assertion.

The final benefit that vitest-when brings to the table is **strict typing when
using TypeScript**. The arguments to both `calledWith` and `thenReturn` (and
other behaviors) are checked against the mock function's arguments and return
type, which helps you update tests during refactors _before_ you start getting
annoyed. As of vitest 0.32.0, `mockReturnValue` (and friends) are typechecked
but `expect().toHaveBeenCalledWith` is not.

## Try it yourself

If you enjoy using Vitest and you use mock functions in your test suites, you
should give [vitest-when][] a try! Incorporating this style of stubbing has
dramatically improved the quality of my code and tests, and I think it could do
the same for you.

```shell
npm install --save-dev vitest-when
```
